    my $self = shift; 
    my $extra_args = $self->extra_args // {};
    my $meta = $self->meta;
    my %hash = %$self;
    for my $name (sort keys %hash) {
        my $attr = $meta->get_attribute($name);
        if (defined $attr) {
            my $value = $hash{$name};
            my $type = $attr->type_constraint;
            if ($type && $type->equals('Bool')) {
                $hash{$name} = $value ? \1 : \ 0;
            }
        }
