# VERSION

# ABSTRACT: Table view for detailed data viewing. The data are arranged in a grid of rows and columns. Most styling can be specified for columns, rows or individual cells. Table is using a column-major order, ie. the grid is represented as a vector of column vectors.

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=cut

sub TO_JSON {
    my $self = shift; 
    my $extra_args = $self->extra_args // {};
    my $meta = $self->meta;
    my %hash = %$self;
    for my $name (sort keys %hash) {
        my $attr = $meta->get_attribute($name);
        if (defined $attr) {
            my $value = $hash{$name};
            my $type = $attr->type_constraint;
            if ($type && $type->equals('Bool')) {
                $hash{$name} = $value ? \1 : \ 0;
            }
        }
    }
    %hash = (%hash, %$extra_args);
    delete $hash{'extra_args'};
    if ($self->can('type') && (!defined $hash{'type'})) {
        $hash{type} = $self->type();
    }
    return \%hash;
}

=head2 type

Trace type.

=cut

=item * columnorder

Specifies the rendered order of the data columns; for example, a value `2` at position `0` means that column index `0` in the data will be rendered as the third column, as columns have an index base of zero.

=cut

has columnorder => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "ArrayRef|PDL",

Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  columnorder .

=item * columnwidth

The width of columns expressed as a ratio. Columns fill the available width in proportion of their specified column widths.

=item * customdata

Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements
