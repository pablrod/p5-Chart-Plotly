But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

    my $self = shift; 
    my $extra_args = $self->extra_args // {};
    my $meta = $self->meta;
    my %hash = %$self;

        my $attr = $meta->get_attribute($name);

=cut

has font => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Maybe[HashRef]|Chart::Plotly::Trace::Heatmapgl::Colorbar::Title::Font",
);

=item * side

Determines the location of color bar's title with respect to the color bar. Defaults to *top* when `orientation` if *v* and  defaults to *right* when `orientation` if *h*. Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated `titleside` attribute.

    is => "rw",

    documentation => "Determines the location of color bar's title with respect to the color bar. Defaults to *top* when `orientation` if *v* and  defaults to *right* when `orientation` if *h*. Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated `titleside` attribute.",
);

=item * text

Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of `title.text`, the title's contents used to be defined as the `title` attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated.
