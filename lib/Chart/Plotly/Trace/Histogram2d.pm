# VERSION

# ABSTRACT: The sample data from which statistics are computed is set in `x` and `y` (where `x` and `y` represent marginal distributions, binning is set in `xbins` and `ybins` in this case) or `z` (where `z` represent the 2D distribution and binning set, binning is set by `x` and `y` in this case). The resulting distribution is visualized as a heatmap.

# EXAMPLE: examples/traces/histogram2d.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The sample data from which statistics are computed is set in `x` and `y` (where `x` and `y` represent marginal distributions, binning is set in `xbins` and `ybins` in this case) or `z` (where `z` represent the 2D distribution and binning set, binning is set by `x` and `y` in this case). The resulting distribution is visualized as a heatmap.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

    my $extra_args = $self->extra_args // {};
    my $meta = $self->meta;
    my %hash = %$self;

=item * autobinx

Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-determined separately and `autobinx` is not needed. However, we accept `autobinx: true` or `false` and will update `xbins` accordingly before deleting `autobinx` from the trace.

=item * autocolorscale

Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or `autocolorscale` is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the `color` array are all positive, all negative or mixed.

Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are *coloraxis*, *coloraxis2*, *coloraxis3*, etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`, `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis.

=item * xhoverformat

Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: *%h* for half of the year as a decimal number as well as *%{n}f* for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with tickformat *%H~%M~%S.%2f* would display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.
