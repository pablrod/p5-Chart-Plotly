# VERSION

# ABSTRACT: The ohlc (short for Open-High-Low-Close) is a style of financial chart describing open, high, low and close for a given `x` coordinate (most likely time). The tip of the lines represent the `low` and `high` values and the horizontal segments represent the `open` and `close` values. Sample points where the close value is higher (lower) then the open value are called increasing (decreasing). By default, increasing items are drawn in green whereas decreasing are drawn in red.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The ohlc (short for Open-High-Low-Close) is a style of financial chart describing open, high, low and close for a given `x` coordinate (most likely time). The tip of the lines represent the `low` and `high` values and the horizontal segments represent the `open` and `close` values. Sample points where the close value is higher (lower) then the open value are called increasing (decreasing). By default, increasing items are drawn in green whereas decreasing are drawn in red.

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
