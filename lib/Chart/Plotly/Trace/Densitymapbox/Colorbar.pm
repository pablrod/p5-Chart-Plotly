# EXAMPLE: examples/traces/densitymapbox.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This attribute is part of the possible options for the trace densitymapbox.

This file has been autogenerated from the official plotly.js source.

If you like Plotly, please support them: L<https://plot.ly/> 
Open source announcement: L<https://plot.ly/javascript/open-source-announcement/>

Full reference: L<https://plot.ly/javascript/reference/#densitymapbox>

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=item * bgcolor

Sets the color of padded area.

=cut

has bgcolor => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Str",
    documentation => "Sets the color of padded area.",
);

=item * bordercolor

Sets the axis line color.

=cut

has bordercolor => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Str",
    documentation => "Sets the axis line color.",
);

=item * borderwidth

Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar.

=cut

has borderwidth => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Num",
    documentation => "Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar.",
);

=item * dtick

Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L<f>*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *n* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*
