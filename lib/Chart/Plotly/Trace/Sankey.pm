This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=cut

sub TO_JSON {
    my $self = shift; 
    my $extra_args = $self->extra_args // {};
    my $meta = $self->meta;
    my %hash = %$self;
    for my $name (sort keys %hash) {
        my $attr = $meta->get_attribute($name);
        if (defined $attr) {
            my $value = $hash{$name};
            my $type = $attr->type_constraint;
            if ($type && $type->equals('Bool')) {
                $hash{$name} = $value ? \1 : \ 0;
            }
        }
    }
    my $plotly_meta = delete $hash{'pmeta'};
    if (defined $plotly_meta) {
        $hash{'meta'} = $plotly_meta;
    }
    %hash = (%hash, %$extra_args);
    delete $hash{'extra_args'};
    if ($self->can('type') && (!defined $hash{'type'})) {
        $hash{type} = $self->type();
    }
    return \%hash;
}

=head2 type

Trace type.

=cut

	my @components = split(/::/, __PACKAGE__);
	return lc($components[-1]);
}

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=cut

=item * arrangement

If value is `snap` (the default), the node arrangement is assisted by automatic snapping of elements to preserve space between nodes specified via `nodepad`. If value is `perpendicular`, the nodes can only move along a line perpendicular to the flow. If value is `freeform`, the nodes can freely move on the plane. If value is `fixed`, the nodes are stationary.

=cut

    is => "rw",

=item * customdata

    isa => "ArrayRef|PDL",
    documentation => "Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements",

=item * domain


=cut

has domain => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Maybe[HashRef]|Chart::Plotly::Trace::Sankey::Domain",
);

=item * hoverinfo

Determines which trace information appear on hover. If `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover events are still fired. Note that this attribute is superseded by `node.hoverinfo` and `node.hoverinfo` for nodes and links respectively.

=cut

has hoverlabel => (

=item * legendrank

Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items.

=item * pmeta

Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text` `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label` text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta` values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace index.

=item * name

Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the legend item and on hover.

=item * orientation

Sets the orientation of the Sankey diagram.

=cut

has orientation => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => enum(["v","h"]),
    documentation => "Sets the orientation of the Sankey diagram.",
);

=item * selectedpoints

Array containing integer indices of selected points. Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.

=cut

    is => "rw",

=item * textfont


=cut

has textfont => (

=item * uid

Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object constancy between traces during animations and transitions.

=cut

has uid => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Str",
    documentation => "Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object constancy between traces during animations and transitions.",
);

=item * uirevision

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
