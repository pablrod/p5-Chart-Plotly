# ABSTRACT: This attribute is one of the possible options for the trace histogram.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

# EXAMPLE: examples/traces/histogram.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This attribute is part of the possible options for the trace histogram.

This file has been autogenerated from the official plotly.js source.

If you like Plotly, please support them: L<https://plot.ly/> 
Open source announcement: L<https://plot.ly/javascript/open-source-announcement/>

Full reference: L<https://plot.ly/javascript/reference/#histogram>

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=cut

    my $self = shift; 
    my $extra_args = $self->extra_args // {};
    my $meta = $self->meta;
    my %hash = %$self;
    for my $name (sort keys %hash) {
        my $attr = $meta->get_attribute($name);
        if (defined $attr) {
            my $value = $hash{$name};

=item * autocolorscale

Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by `marker.colorscale`. Has an effect only if in `marker.color` is set to a numerical array. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or `autocolorscale` is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the `color` array are all positive, all negative or mixed.

=cut

has autocolorscale => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Bool",
    documentation => "Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by `marker.colorscale`.

);

=item * cauto

Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in `marker.color`) or the bounds set in `marker.cmin` and `marker.cmax` Has an effect only if in `marker.color` is set to a numerical array. Defaults to `false` when `marker.cmin` and `marker.cmax` are set by the user.

);

=item * cmax

Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in `marker.color` is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in `marker.color` and if set, `marker.cmin` must be set as well.

=cut

has cmax => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Num",

);

=item * cmid

Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling `marker.cmin` and/or `marker.cmax` to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if in `marker.color` is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in `marker.color`. Has no effect when `marker.cauto` is `false`.

);

=item * cmin

Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in `marker.color` is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in `marker.color` and if set, `marker.cmax` must be set as well.

=cut

has cmin => (

);

=item * color

Sets the marker color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to `marker.cmin` and `marker.cmax` if set.

=cut

has color => (
    is => "rw",

);

=item * coloraxis

Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are *coloraxis*, *coloraxis2*, *coloraxis3*, etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`, `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis.

=item * colorbar


=cut

has colorbar => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Maybe[HashRef]|Chart::Plotly::Trace::Histogram::Marker::Colorbar",
);

=item * colorscale

Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in `marker.color` is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]`. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use `marker.cmin` and `marker.cmax`. Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd.
