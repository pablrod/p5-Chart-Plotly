# VERSION

# ABSTRACT: Each box spans from quartile 1 (Q1) to quartile 3 (Q3). The second quartile (Q2, i.e. the median) is marked by a line inside the box. The fences grow outward from the boxes' edges, by default they span +/- 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR: Q3-Q1), The sample mean and standard deviation as well as notches and the sample, outlier and suspected outliers points can be optionally added to the box plot. The values and positions corresponding to each boxes can be input using two signatures. The first signature expects users to supply the sample values in the `y` data array for vertical boxes (`x` for horizontal boxes). By supplying an `x` (`y`) array, one box per distinct `x` (`y`) value is drawn If no `x` (`y`) {array} is provided, a single box is drawn. In this case, the box is positioned with the trace `name` or with `x0` (`y0`) if provided. The second signature expects users to supply the boxes corresponding Q1, median and Q3 statistics in the `q1`, `median` and `q3` data arrays respectively. Other box features relying on statistics namely `lowerfence`, `upperfence`, `notchspan` can be set directly by the users. To have plotly compute them or to show sample points besides the boxes, users can set the `y` data array for vertical boxes (`x` for horizontal boxes) to a 2D array with the outer length corresponding to the number of boxes in the traces and the inner length corresponding the sample size.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Each box spans from quartile 1 (Q1) to quartile 3 (Q3). The second quartile (Q2, i.e. the median) is marked by a line inside the box. The fences grow outward from the boxes' edges, by default they span +/- 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR: Q3-Q1), The sample mean and standard deviation as well as notches and the sample, outlier and suspected outliers points can be optionally added to the box plot. The values and positions corresponding to each boxes can be input using two signatures. The first signature expects users to supply the sample values in the `y` data array for vertical boxes (`x` for horizontal boxes). By supplying an `x` (`y`) array, one box per distinct `x` (`y`) value is drawn If no `x` (`y`) {array} is provided, a single box is drawn. In this case, the box is positioned with the trace `name` or with `x0` (`y0`) if provided. The second signature expects users to supply the boxes corresponding Q1, median and Q3 statistics in the `q1`, `median` and `q3` data arrays respectively. Other box features relying on statistics namely `lowerfence`, `upperfence`, `notchspan` can be set directly by the users. To have plotly compute them or to show sample points besides the boxes, users can set the `y` data array for vertical boxes (`x` for horizontal boxes) to a 2D array with the outer length corresponding to the number of boxes in the traces and the inner length corresponding the sample size.

The *linear* method uses the 25th percentile for Q1 and 75th percentile for Q3 as computed using method #10 (listed on http://jse.amstat.org/v14n3/langford.html). The *exclusive* method uses the median to divide the ordered dataset into two halves if the sample is odd, it does not include the median in either half - Q1 is then the median of the lower half and Q3 the median of the upper half. The *inclusive* method also uses the median to divide the ordered dataset into two halves but if the sample is odd, it includes the median in both halves - Q1 is then the median of the lower half and Q3 the median of the upper half.

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`.

Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
