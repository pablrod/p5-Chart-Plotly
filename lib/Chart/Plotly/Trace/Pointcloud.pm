=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

    my $extra_args = $self->extra_args // {};
    my $meta = $self->meta;
    my %hash = %$self;

A sequential value, 0..n, supply it to avoid creating this array inside plotting. If specified, it must be a typed `Int32Array` array. Its length must be equal to or greater than the number of points. For the best performance and memory use, create one large `indices` typed array that is guaranteed to be at least as long as the largest number of points during use, and reuse it on each `Plotly.restyle()` call.

Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items.

To access the trace `meta` values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` item in question.

=item * stream


=cut

has stream => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Maybe[HashRef]|Chart::Plotly::Trace::Pointcloud::Stream",
);

=item * text

Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates. If trace `hoverinfo` contains a *text* flag and *hovertext* is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels.

Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object constancy between traces during animations and transitions.

has uid => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Str",

=item * uirevision

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
