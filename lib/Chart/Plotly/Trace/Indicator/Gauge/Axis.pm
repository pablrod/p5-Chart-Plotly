=head1 SYNOPSIS

# EXAMPLE: examples/traces/indicator.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This attribute is part of the possible options for the trace indicator.

This file has been autogenerated from the official plotly.js source.

If you like Plotly, please support them: L<https://plot.ly/> 
Open source announcement: L<https://plot.ly/javascript/open-source-announcement/>

Full reference: L<https://plot.ly/javascript/reference/#indicator>

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=cut

    my $self = shift; 
    my $extra_args = $self->extra_args // {};
    my $meta = $self->meta;
    my %hash = %$self;

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=item * dtick

Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L<f>*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *n* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*

=item * exponentformat

Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If *none*, it appears as 1,000,000,000. If *e*, 1e+9. If *E*, 1E+9. If *power*, 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If *SI*, 1G. If *B*, 1B.

=item * tick0

Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with `dtick`.

If the axis `type` is *date*, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis `type` is *category*, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.

Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: *%h* for half of the year as a decimal number as well as *%{n}f* for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with tickformat *%H~%M~%S.%2f* would display *09~15~23.46*
