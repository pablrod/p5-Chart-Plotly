=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=cut

sub TO_JSON {
    my $self = shift; 
    my $extra_args = $self->extra_args // {};
    my $meta = $self->meta;
    my %hash = %$self;
    for my $name (sort keys %hash) {
        my $attr = $meta->get_attribute($name);
        if (defined $attr) {
            my $value = $hash{$name};
            my $type = $attr->type_constraint;
            if ($type && $type->equals('Bool')) {
                $hash{$name} = $value ? \1 : \ 0;
            }
        }
    }
    %hash = (%hash, %$extra_args);
    delete $hash{'extra_args'};
    if ($self->can('type') && (!defined $hash{'type'})) {
        $hash{type} = $self->type();

    return \%hash;

=over

=cut

=item * maxpoints

Sets the maximum number of points to keep on the plots from an incoming stream. If `maxpoints` is set to *50*, only the newest 50 points will be displayed on the plot.

has maxpoints => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Num",
    documentation => "Sets the maximum number of points to keep on the plots from an incoming stream. If `maxpoints` is set to *50*, only the newest 50 points will be displayed on the plot.",
);

=item * token

The stream id number links a data trace on a plot with a stream. See https://chart-studio.plotly.com/settings for more details.
