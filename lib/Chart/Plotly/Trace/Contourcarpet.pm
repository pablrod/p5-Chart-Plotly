# VERSION

# ABSTRACT: Plots contours on either the first carpet axis or the carpet axis with a matching `carpet` attribute. Data `z` is interpreted as matching that of the corresponding carpet axis.

But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`.

Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
