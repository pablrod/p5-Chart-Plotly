# VERSION

# ABSTRACT: The data the describes the coordinates of the surface is set in `z`. Data in `z` should be a {2D array}. Coordinates in `x` and `y` can either be 1D {arrays} or {2D arrays} (e.g. to graph parametric surfaces). If not provided in `x` and `y`, the x and y coordinates are assumed to be linear starting at 0 with a unit step. The color scale corresponds to the `z` values by default. For custom color scales, use `surfacecolor` which should be a {2D array}, where its bounds can be controlled using `cmin` and `cmax`.

Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

=item * xhoverformat

Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: *%h* for half of the year as a decimal number as well as *%{n}f* for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with tickformat *%H~%M~%S.%2f* would display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.
