# VERSION

# ABSTRACT: The data from which contour lines are computed is set in `z`. Data in `z` must be a {2D array} of numbers. Say that `z` has N rows and M columns, then by default, these N rows correspond to N y coordinates (set in `y` or auto-generated) and the M columns correspond to M x coordinates (set in `x` or auto-generated). By setting `transpose` to *true*, the above behavior is flipped.

The data from which contour lines are computed is set in `z`. Data in `z` must be a {2D array} of numbers. Say that `z` has N rows and M columns, then by default, these N rows correspond to N y coordinates (set in `y` or auto-generated) and the M columns correspond to M x coordinates (set in `x` or auto-generated). By setting `transpose` to *true*, the above behavior is flipped.

=head1 METHODS

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

    my $extra_args = $self->extra_args // {};
    my $meta = $self->meta;
    my %hash = %$self;

=item * autocolorscale

Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the `color` array are all positive, all negative or mixed.

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`.

Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in `z`) or the bounds set in `zmin` and `zmax`  Defaults to `false` when `zmin` and `zmax` are set by the user.

=item * zhoverformat

Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. See: https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format

=item * zmax

Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmin` must be set as well.

=item * zmid

Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling `zmin` and/or `zmax` to be equidistant to this point. Value should have the same units as in `z`. Has no effect when `zauto` is `false`.
