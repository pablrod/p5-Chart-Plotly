=head1 DESCRIPTION

This attribute is part of the possible options for the trace histogram2dcontour.

This file has been autogenerated from the official plotly.js source.

=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=cut

sub TO_JSON {
    my $self = shift; 
    my $extra_args = $self->extra_args // {};
    my $meta = $self->meta;
    my %hash = %$self;
    for my $name (sort keys %hash) {
        my $attr = $meta->get_attribute($name);
        if (defined $attr) {
            my $value = $hash{$name};
            my $type = $attr->type_constraint;
            if ($type && $type->equals('Bool')) {
                $hash{$name} = $value ? \1 : \ 0;
            }
        }
    }
    %hash = (%hash, %$extra_args);
    delete $hash{'extra_args'};
    if ($self->can('type') && (!defined $hash{'type'})) {
        $hash{type} = $self->type();
    }
    return \%hash;

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=cut

=item * end

Sets the end value for the x axis bins. The last bin may not end exactly at this value, we increment the bin edge by `size` from `start` until we reach or exceed `end`. Defaults to the maximum data value. Like `start`, for dates use a date string, and for category data `end` is based on the category serial numbers.

=cut

has end => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Any",
    documentation => "Sets the end value for the x axis bins. The last bin may not end exactly at this value, we increment the bin edge by `size` from `start` until we reach or exceed `end`.

);

=item * size

Sets the size of each x axis bin. Default behavior: If `nbinsx` is 0 or omitted, we choose a nice round bin size such that the number of bins is about the same as the typical number of samples in each bin. If `nbinsx` is provided, we choose a nice round bin size giving no more than that many bins. For date data, use milliseconds or *n* for months, as in `axis.dtick`. For category data, the number of categories to bin together (always defaults to 1).

);

=item * start

Sets the starting value for the x axis bins. Defaults to the minimum data value, shifted down if necessary to make nice round values and to remove ambiguous bin edges. For example, if most of the data is integers we shift the bin edges 0.5 down, so a `size` of 5 would have a default `start` of -0.5, so it is clear that 0-4 are in the first bin, 5-9 in the second, but continuous data gets a start of 0 and bins [0,5), [5,10) etc. Dates behave similarly, and `start` should be a date string. For category data, `start` is based on the category serial numbers, and defaults to -0.5.
