# VERSION

# ABSTRACT: Draws waterfall trace which is useful graph to displays the contribution of various elements (either positive or negative) in a bar chart. The data visualized by the span of the bars is set in `y` if `orientation` is set th *v* (the default) and the labels are set in `x`. By setting `orientation` to *h*, the roles are interchanged.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Draws waterfall trace which is useful graph to displays the contribution of various elements (either positive or negative) in a bar chart. The data visualized by the span of the bars is set in `y` if `orientation` is set th *v* (the default) and the labels are set in `x`. By setting `orientation` to *h*, the roles are interchanged.

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=item * uirevision

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.",

Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If *legendonly*, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible).

=item * xhoverformat

Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: *%h* for half of the year as a decimal number as well as *%{n}f* for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with tickformat *%H~%M~%S.%2f* would display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.
