# VERSION

# ABSTRACT: Draws waterfall trace which is useful graph to displays the contribution of various elements (either positive or negative) in a bar chart. The data visualized by the span of the bars is set in `y` if `orientation` is set th *v* (the default) and the labels are set in `x`. By setting `orientation` to *h*, the roles are interchanged.

# EXAMPLE: examples/traces/waterfall.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Draws waterfall trace which is useful graph to displays the contribution of various elements (either positive or negative) in a bar chart. The data visualized by the span of the bars is set in `y` if `orientation` is set th *v* (the default) and the labels are set in `x`. By setting `orientation` to *h*, the roles are interchanged.

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

Sets the x coordinates.

=item * x0

Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting coordinate and `dx` the step.

=item * xaxis

Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and a 2D cartesian x axis. If *x* (the default value), the x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If *x2*, the x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
