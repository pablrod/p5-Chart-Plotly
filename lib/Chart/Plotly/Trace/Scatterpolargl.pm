# VERSION

# ABSTRACT: The scatterpolargl trace type encompasses line charts, scatter charts, and bubble charts in polar coordinates using the WebGL plotting engine. The data visualized as scatter point or lines is set in `r` (radial) and `theta` (angular) coordinates Bubble charts are achieved by setting `marker.size` and/or `marker.color` to numerical arrays.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The scatterpolargl trace type encompasses line charts, scatter charts, and bubble charts in polar coordinates using the WebGL plotting engine. The data visualized as scatter point or lines is set in `r` (radial) and `theta` (angular) coordinates Bubble charts are achieved by setting `marker.size` and/or `marker.color` to numerical arrays.

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=cut

sub TO_JSON {
    my $self = shift; 
    my $extra_args = $self->extra_args // {};
    my $meta = $self->meta;
    my %hash = %$self;
    for my $name (sort keys %hash) {
        my $attr = $meta->get_attribute($name);
        if (defined $attr) {
            my $value = $hash{$name};
            my $type = $attr->type_constraint;

=item * customdata

Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, *scatter* traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements

=item * dr

Sets the r coordinate step.

=cut

has dr => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Num",
    documentation => "Sets the r coordinate step.",
);

=item * dtheta

Sets the theta coordinate step. By default, the `dtheta` step equals the subplot's period divided by the length of the `r` coordinates.

=item * fill

Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to *none* unless this trace is stacked, then it gets *tonexty* (*tonextx*) if `orientation` is *v* (*h*) Use with `fillcolor` if not *none*. *tozerox* and *tozeroy* fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. *tonextx* and *tonexty* fill between the endpoints of this trace and the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave like *tozerox* and *tozeroy*. *toself* connects the endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if it has gaps) into a closed shape. *tonext* fills the space between two traces if one completely encloses the other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like *toself* if there is no trace before it. *tonext* should not be used if one trace does not enclose the other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be filled to) other traces in the same group. With multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.

Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override `hoverinfo`.

When showing info for several points, *xother* will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after *(x|y)other* will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example "Price: %{y:$.2f}". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax.

The variables available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is displayed in the secondary box, for example "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.

=item * uirevision

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.",

Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If *legendonly*, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible).
