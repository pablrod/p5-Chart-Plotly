=head1 DISCLAIMER

This is an unofficial Plotly Perl module. Currently I'm not affiliated in any way with Plotly. 
But I think plotly.js is a great library and I want to use it with perl.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 TO_JSON

Serialize the trace to JSON. This method should be called only by L<JSON> serializer.

=cut

sub TO_JSON {
    my $self = shift; 
    my $extra_args = $self->extra_args // {};
    my $meta = $self->meta;
    my %hash = %$self;
    for my $name (sort keys %hash) {
        my $attr = $meta->get_attribute($name);
        if (defined $attr) {
            my $value = $hash{$name};
            my $type = $attr->type_constraint;
            if ($type && $type->equals('Bool')) {
                $hash{$name} = $value ? \1 : \ 0;
            }
        }
    }
    my $plotly_meta = delete $hash{'pmeta'};
    if (defined $plotly_meta) {
        $hash{'meta'} = $plotly_meta;
    }
    %hash = (%hash, %$extra_args);
    delete $hash{'extra_args'};
    if ($self->can('type') && (!defined $hash{'type'})) {
        $hash{type} = $self->type();
    }
    return \%hash;
}

=head2 type

Trace type.

=cut

sub type {
	my @components = split(/::/, __PACKAGE__);
	return lc($components[-1]);
}

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=cut

=item * arrangement

Sets the drag interaction mode for categories and dimensions. If `perpendicular`, the categories can only move along a line perpendicular to the paths. If `freeform`, the categories can freely move on the plane. If `fixed`, the categories and dimensions are stationary.

=cut

has arrangement => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => enum(["perpendicular","freeform","fixed"]),
    documentation => "Sets the drag interaction mode for categories and dimensions. If `perpendicular`, the categories can only move along a line perpendicular to the paths. If `freeform`, the categories can freely move on the plane. If `fixed`, the categories and dimensions are stationary.",
);

=item * bundlecolors

Sort paths so that like colors are bundled together within each category.

=cut

has bundlecolors => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Bool",
    documentation => "Sort paths so that like colors are bundled together within each category.",
);

=item * counts

The number of observations represented by each state. Defaults to 1 so that each state represents one observation

=cut

has counts => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Num|ArrayRef[Num]",
    documentation => "The number of observations represented by each state. Defaults to 1 so that each state represents one observation",
);

=item * countssrc

Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for `counts`.

=cut

has countssrc => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Str",
    documentation => "Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for `counts`.",
);

=item * dimensions


=cut

has dimensions => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "ArrayRef|ArrayRef[Chart::Plotly::Trace::Parcats::Dimension]",
);

=item * domain


=cut

has domain => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Maybe[HashRef]|Chart::Plotly::Trace::Parcats::Domain",
);

=item * hoverinfo

Determines which trace information appear on hover. If `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover events are still fired.

=cut

has hoverinfo => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => "Str",
    documentation => "Determines which trace information appear on hover. If `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover events are still fired.",
);

=item * hoveron

Sets the hover interaction mode for the parcats diagram. If `category`, hover interaction take place per category. If `color`, hover interactions take place per color per category. If `dimension`, hover interactions take place across all categories per dimension.

=cut

has hoveron => (
    is => "rw",
    isa => enum(["category","color","dimension"]),
    documentation => "Sets the hover interaction mode for the parcats diagram. If `category`, hover interaction take place per category. If `color`, hover interactions take place per color per category. If `dimension`, hover interactions take place across all categories per dimension.",
);

=item * hovertemplate

Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example "y: %{y}" as well as %{xother}, {%_xother}, {%_xother_}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, *xother* will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after *(x|y)other* will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example "Price: %{y:$.2f}". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example "Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are available. variables `count`, `probability`, `category`, `categorycount`, `colorcount` and `bandcolorcount`. Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is displayed in the secondary box, for example "<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.

=item * pmeta

Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text` `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label` text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta` values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace index.

    isa => enum(["forward","backward"]),

=item * uirevision

Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
